    h "The rain continued to fall, showing no signs of stopping or slowing anytime soon."

    h "I realized that we must be a sight: Two people laying out in an open field in the middle of a rainstorm."

    h "'Are they alright? Do they need help? Do they have no where else to go?'"

    h "..."

    h "Water beads up on my face as I make no effort to avoid it."

    hn "I have never really noticed how warm summer rain is. I always associated the rain with being cold, wet, and alone. But I am quite comfortable right now."

    hn "I can feel a small pool of water gathering around me in the grass, soaking through the back of my shirt as it grows. I will definitely be cold later, when I have to get up. And explaining this to my roommate..."

    hn "..."

    hn "....."
    
    hn "..."

    hn "Like most things that are important to me, I am sure that this will not be easy to explain."

    hn "But for now, I am warm, and we are together. After all that has happened; In spite of all that has happened, we still have found each other, and in this one perfect moment we are together."

    hn "Unseen, my hand finds its way into theirs, and holds on tightly."

    hn "I feel a small squeeze."

    hn "It is amazing how something so simple can be so reassuring, so intimate and full of emotion, as someone softly squeezing your hand back."
